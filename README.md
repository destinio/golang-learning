### `*` and `&`

- `&` goes in front of a variable when you want to get that variable's memory address.
- `*` goes in front of a variable that holds a memory address and resolves it (it is therefore the counterpart to the `&` operator). It goes and gets the thing that the pointer was pointing at, e.g. `*myString`
